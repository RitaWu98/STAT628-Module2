    "In the data preprocessing part, we first examine whether the data has abnormal observations from following 3 aspects:\n",
    "1. According to histogram plot of `BODYFAT`, we find that observation `IDNO=182` has feature `BODYFAT=0`, which is apparently can not happen in the real world, therefore we remove this observation.\n",
    "2. As Siri's equation shown, `BODYFAT` goes linear with `1/DENSITY`. After fitting the linear regression model between `BODYFAT` and `1/DENSITY`  we find observations with `IDNO=48,76,96` are outliers according to remedies plots. Since we can not decide neither `BODYFAT` nor `1/DENSITY` are trustworth, we choose to delete these three points.\n",
    "3. According to calculation formula of BMI (BMI=703Weight/Height^2), we find observation `IDNO=42` has apparently wrong height, we remove this observation and re-fit the linear model between `ADIPOSITY` and `WEIGHT/HEIGHT^2`. According to the remedies plots of re-fitted model, observations with `IDNO=163,221` are outliers. After looking through whole data, we cannot determine which feature's value is convincing and finally remove these two outliers. As for observation `IDNO=42`, we use the re-fitted model to correct its height.\n",
    "4. Except for above approches, we also take a look of other features, we find observation with `IDNO=39` has extremely large values in certain features. While we think this kind of person may be truly exist, we choose to keep this observation.\n",

    "After removing several suspectable observations, we fit the full model with remain data and do further detection for linear regression model. It can be shown from the remedies plots of full model that there are no obvious outliers anymore. Except for outliers, we make normal Q-Q plot for residuals and also perform Box-Cox transformation of the full model. Both of these two methods show that remained data are good enough so we have no need to do transformation."
