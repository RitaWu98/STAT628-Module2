    "The body fat percentage (BFP) of a human is defined as the total mass of fat divided by total body mass, multiplied by 100. BFP is of great importance in measuring the well-being of individuals and predicting the risk of illness. However, the measurement of BFP has faced a trade-off problem between measurement accuracy and approach flexibility for a long time. Some methods that involve underwater measuring may not be generalized to people's daily life, while other methods which must consider a large number of variables neither is an idealized choice. \n",
    "Therefore finding a method that achieves both simplicity and exactitude in calculating BFP is our ultimate goal in conducting this project."

    "In the data preprocessing part, we first examine whether the data has abnormal observations from the following 4 aspects:\n",
    "1. According to the histogram plot of `BODYFAT`, we find that observation `IDNO=182` has feature `BODYFAT=0`, which is apparently can not happen in the real world, therefore we remove this observation.\n",
    "2. As Siri's equation shown, `BODYFAT` goes linear with `1/DENSITY`. After fitting the linear regression model between `BODYFAT` and `1/DENSITY`  we find observations with `IDNO=48,76,96` are outliers according to remedies plots. Since we can not decide neither `BODYFAT` nor `1/DENSITY` is trustworthy, we choose to delete these three points.\n",
    "3. According to the calculation formula of BMI (BMI=703Weight/Height^2), we find observation `IDNO=42` has the wrong height, we remove this observation and re-fit the linear model between `ADIPOSITY` and `WEIGHT/HEIGHT^2`. According to the remedies plots of the re-fitted model, observations with `IDNO=163,221` are outliers. After looking through the whole data, we cannot determine which feature's value is convincing and finally remove these two outliers. As for observation `IDNO=42`, we use the re-fitted model to correct its height.\n",
    "4. Except for the above approaches, we also take a look at other features. The correlation plot shows that there is strong multicollinearity between certain variables. The observation with `IDNO=39` has extremely large values in certain features. While we think this kind of person may truly exist, we choose to keep this observation in our dataset."
