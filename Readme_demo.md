## Background

The body fat percentage (BFP) of a human is defined as the total mass of fat divided by total body mass, multiplied by 100. <br/>
BFP is of great importance in measuring the well-being of individuals and predicting the risk of illness. <br/>
However, the measurement of BFP has faced a trade-off problem between measurement accuracy and approach flexibility for a long time. Some methods that involve underwater measuring may not be generalized to people's daily life, while other methods which must consider a large number of variables neither is an idealized choice. <br/>
Therefore finding a method that achieves both simplicity and exactitude in calculating BFP is our ultimate goal in conducting this project.<br/>
